            Nestled in the heart of lush greenery, this nature reserve offers a serene escape where visitors can enjoy a leisurely stroll amidst a vibrant array of bird species. The Rhinoceros Hornbill, recognized as Malaysia’s national bird, is known for its striking casque atop its beak. These large birds are often seen in the rainforests of Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia. Another fascinating species is the Malayan Whistling-thrush, an elusive bird endemic to Malaysia, typically found in montane forests. It is celebrated for its beautiful whistling calls, adding a melodious charm to the serene forest environment. As you wander through the winding paths, you’ll be serenaded by the melodious calls of colorful parrots, the gentle cooing of doves, and the cheerful chirping of finches.
